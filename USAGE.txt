GeneticCode - A simple evolving code / automaton sandbox.
Copyright (c) 2013, Tim Wiederhake

Usage: java -jar GeneticCode.jar <OPTIONS>

The following <OPTIONS> exits:
--help: Displays this help.
--license: Displays further information about the copyright.
--set <PARAM> <N>: Sets the simulation parameter <PARAM> to the integer
  value <N>, which is silently capped by the same minimum / maximum that
  is displayed in the GUI.
  The following values for <PARAM> are accepted (case-sensitive):
  * FIELD_WIDTH, FIELD_HEIGHT: Field dimensions in number of cells.
    Note that the field always wraps around.
  * INITIAL_FOOD: Initial food on the field in percent.
  * INITIAL_WALL: Initial walls on the field in percent.
  * INITIAL_POPULATION: Initial population size.
  * FIELD_SCALE: Field scale.
  * GRID_GAP: Grid gap width (only affects display).
  * GRID_VISIBILITY: Whether or not the grid should be visible.
    1 for visible / "on", 0 for not visible / "off"  (only affects display).
  * SIMULATION_SPEED: Simulation speed in ticks per second.
  * MUTATION_RATE: Mutation rate in percent.
    Note that always only one entity mutates.
  * REGROWTH_RATE: Regrowth rate in food per 10 ticks.
  * HEALTH_PER_FOOD: Health per Food.
  * HEALTH_PER_STEP: Health loss per step.
  * REPRODUCTION_HP: Health required before reproduction happens.
    Note that when a entity splits, both offsprings each have
    half the health of the original entity.
--seed <N>: Seed the random number generator with the given number.
  Results are only guaranteed to be reproducible using
  the same version on the same JVM and machine.

If a flag is mentioned multiple times (for example: --seed 1 --seed 2),
then the last occurrence will be used (i.e.: -seed 2) unless stated otherwise.
